### Authentic

Authentic is a library to implement username/password authentication easier in buffalo.

#### Demo application

Youn can find a demo application on the `example` folder, its a simple app that checks username and password authentication.

To get it running you need to get into that folder and run:

```
$ buffalo db create
$ buffalo db migrate
$ buffalo db:seed
```

After that you can run the `buffalo dev` command and as usual you can check it on `localhost:3000`.

Default username/password generated are `test@test.com` and `password123`.
